# credit_card_fraud_detection

This project implements credit card fraud detection using a Logistic Regression model. It uses a publicly available dataset containing highly imbalanced transaction data with legitimate and fraudulent classes. To handle this, the dataset is balanced by sampling an equal number of legitimate transactions to match the fraudulent ones. The data is then split into training and testing sets. The Logistic Regression model is trained on the balanced training data and evaluated on both training and test sets. Key libraries used include numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data handling, modeling, and evaluation.
